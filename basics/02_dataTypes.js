//alert("hello") this will show in web browser not in console or not in node js

//we cann't use statement like that
//console.log() console.log()
//for using two different statement in sameline we use ';' for separation it is good practice to use ';' in every statement end.
//And semicolon also increase readability of the code

//Some frequently used dataTypes are

//number => 2 power 53
//bigint
//string => ""
//boolean => true/false
//null => stand alone value or will printing its dataType in console it gives "object"
//undefined => when no any value is defined to the variable
//symbol => unique

//All the avobe are PRIMITIVE dataTypes

//object => important dataType

//now here a keyword "typeof" is used to know the which dataType of variable is.

console.log(typeof "sonu");//string
console.log(typeof 12);//number

let isStudy = true;
console.log(typeof isStudy);//boolean
console.log(typeof null);//object
console.log(typeof undefined);//undefined

//we will see symbol dataType later.
